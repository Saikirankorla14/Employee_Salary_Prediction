# Employee_Salary_Prediction

📌 Project Overview
This project focuses on predicting employee salaries based on their years of experience using Polynomial Regression. It's a regression-based machine learning problem using a simple dataset.
🛠️ Tools & Technologies Used
- Python
- Scikit-learn (for regression modeling)
- Pandas (for data handling)
- NumPy (for numerical operations)
- Matplotlib / Seaborn (for data visualization)
📊 Dataset
Dataset: Salary Data
- Features: Years of Experience
- Target: Salary
This dataset is commonly used for beginner regression tasks.
🚀 Implementation Steps
1. Load the dataset using Pandas.
2. Visualize the data to understand the relationship between experience and salary.
3. Apply Polynomial Regression to capture the non-linear relationship.
4. Train the model and evaluate its performance.
5. Predict salary for new experience inputs.
📈 Learning Outcomes
- Understand regression modeling (especially polynomial regression).
- Learn to visualize data and fit non-linear curves.
- Evaluate model accuracy and generalization.
